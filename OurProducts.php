          <p>Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) produces DC electricity directly
            from the sunlight and is extremely simple to operate
            and maintain. They have a long operating life wide highly reliable and trouble free performance. These are
            totally noiselessand do not produce any environmental
            pollution or ecological imbalance
            <br><br>
            This energy sources are totally modular in nature, therefore,
            the cost per unit installed capacity does not depend very much on the size of the Power Plant.

            <br><br>
            All these important advantages make Solar Photovoltaic Electricity eminently suitable for Various important
            applications. SPV electricity may turn out to be the ideal solution, particularly in remote location, where
            grid
            transmitted and centrally generated electricity is unlikely to be economical, and where the availability of
            such
            electricity cannot be guaranteed on reliable basis. This is due to the fact that the fuel, i.e. The sunlight
            is available
            right at place of use and it does not require qualified technical personnel to operate and maintain the SPV
            energy
            source. <br> <br>
            Indeed, Solar Photovoltaic are rightly projected as one of the most important renewable energy source to the
            supplement and compliment the electrical energy requirements of the dispersed and energy-deficient
            population
            living in the remote and inaccessible areas. <br> <br>
