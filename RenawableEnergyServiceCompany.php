            <p class="">Whether your aim is to cut energy costs, reduce your carbon footprint, fulfil regulatory
              obligations, or accomplish your sustainability goals, BREL provides solution for each of these. We provide
              rooftop solar power solutions with zero investment at a discount to grid tariff. In certain states, we
              also supply power through the grid from solar and hybrid farms. If you prefer to make the investment
              yourself, we also offer a “CAPEX model”..</p>

      <p>The RESCO Model is favoured by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for solar rooftop installation, and
        is effectively the same as the OPEX Model, in which the customer only pays for the energy consumed, at a tariff
        lower than the grid electricity tariff, with zero investment, thus saving money in the process. The RESCO Model
        is used by various Government ministries to issue tenders to install rooftop solar plants, particularly on
        buildings owned or operated by the government, educational institutes and non-profit organizations. Both the
        Central and State Government agencies sometimes provide subsidies and favourable regulations for RESCO solar
        developers. </p>

        <h3>No unfornt investment</h3>
        <p>Unlike a solar EPC or capex proposition, wherein the consumer owns the system and invests upfront, the RESCO
          model is a zero-investment model in which the consumer pays only for the electricity generated, while the
          solar plant is owned by the RESCO developer. You can enjoy the electricity that is generated without worrying
          about any of the associated operations and maintenance issues. In return, all you need to do is pay a
          pre-decided monthly tariff which is lower than prevailing grid electricity tariff.</p>

        <h3>Government support</h3>
        <p>In order to meet its goal of 40GW of rooftop solar by 2022, both the Central and State Government agencies
          offer generous and favourable regulations for RESCO solar developers. In a few special categories in some
          states, RESCO model developers enjoy up to 70% subsidy for RESCO projects on government building.
        <p>Despite an increase in demand, there are still a few risks involved in setting up a solar plant. So the end
          users are naturally hesitant to make a large investment and opt for the CAPEX model. RESCO models, such as the
          ones offered by BREL, allay all their fears and concerns. In addition, the attractive tariffs make the RESCO
          model preferable to large energy consumers, be it industrial, commercial or institutional.</p>

            solution along with energy storage. Typical cost savings for a consumer ranges from 20% to 40% lower than
            the grid tariffs. Operation and maintenance will be handled by us. Sign a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)

        <h2 class="text-center">OPEX Vs CAPEX</h2>
        <p>Switching to solar power is a commendable move for your business, and a cost-effective one too in the long
          run. However, there are a lot of underlying technicalities you need to know before making the final move to go
          green.</p>
        <p>When you are considering buying solar power, you would generally find two options in the market - Investing
          into a rooftop solar plant or buying solar power under a power purchase agreement (PPA). Both the options can
          be availed under two models: the capital expenditure (CAPEX) model or the operating expenditure (OPEX) model.
          In this section, we help you make an informed decision by highlighting the differences between the two in
          terms of their merits and disadvantages, and which model suits your business better.</p>
